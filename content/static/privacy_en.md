# Security Measures for Retained Personal Data

To ensure proper handling of personal data, we have established and comply with a privacy policy specifying our name, legal compliance, security measures, and contact points for complaints.
We also implement internal rules for each stage of data handling (acquisition, use, storage, deletion, etc.), and clearly assign roles and responsibilities to relevant personnel.
We designate a person in charge of personal data, clarify which employees may handle such data, and implement a reporting structure for any violations or signs thereof. Regular internal audits and third-party reviews are conducted.
Employees receive regular training and must sign confidentiality agreements regarding personal data.
Access to personal data is physically restricted, and measures are taken to prevent unauthorized viewing. Mobile data carriers are secured and anonymized during transport.
Access control is implemented to limit personnel and database access. Systems are protected against unauthorized access and malicious software.
We use cloud services with servers located outside Japan. To ensure the secure management of retained personal data, we confirm that those servers are either within the EU or the United Kingdom—jurisdictions recognized by the Personal Information Protection Commission as providing protections equivalent to Japan—or that they have obtained CBPR certification. If neither condition is met, we review the personal information protection framework of the relevant foreign country and implement the necessary and appropriate safeguards for the management of personal data.
Currently, the foreign countries to which personal data is provided and information about their regimes are as follows:
United States of America

Commonwealth of Australia
https://www.ppc.go.jp/files/pdf/australia_report.pdf
