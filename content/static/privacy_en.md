## 4. Integration with Third-Party Apps

All such integrations are:

- Configured based on merchant instruction and consent

## 5. Use of Messaging Platforms and Infrastructure Providers

To deliver messages, operate our services, and monitor system behavior, we may use the following external services and infrastructure:

- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: Our services are hosted on AWS infrastructure. Personal data is stored in services such as Amazon RDS and DynamoDB. Emails and SMS may be delivered via **Amazon SES**.
- **SendGrid**: Used for sending transactional and marketing emails/SMS.
- **LINE, WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook Messenger**: For direct messaging with users and receiving replies or webhook data.
- **DataDog**: Used for monitoring application health and recording error logs. While personally identifiable information is not intentionally stored, metadata related to user interactions (e.g., request identifiers, error traces) may be logged during system exceptions.
- **Other third-party apps** (e.g., EasyPoints): Data sharing occurs only when the integration is explicitly enabled by the merchant.

All external services are subject to data protection agreements or equivalent safeguards.

## 6. Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR)

If you are located in the European Economic Area, we rely on the following legal bases:

- Your consent

## 7. Sharing of Personal Information

We do not sell personal data.

We may share your personal information with:

- Cloud infrastructure providers (e.g., AWS)

- Monitoring and logging providers (e.g., DataDog)
- App partners (e.g., EasyPoints) only with merchant consent
- Contractors or service providers performing tasks on our behalf

## 8. International Data Transfers

Groovy Media, Inc. stores and processes all customer and user data primarily in Japan using cloud infrastructure located in the Tokyo region of Amazon Web Services (AWS). This means that, under normal circumstances, no international data transfers occur for Japanese users or Shopify merchants using our application.

However, the following exceptions may apply:

- **SendGrid (Twilio Inc.)**: When using SendGrid to deliver transactional or marketing emails, some metadata or message content may be processed and stored on servers located outside Japan, including in the United States. This may be considered a cross-border data transfer under Japanese privacy laws.
- **Messaging Platforms (LINE, WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook Messenger)**: Depending on user interaction, some communication data may be routed through or stored on servers located outside Japan.

If cross-border transfers are required, we assess the recipient country's data protection regulations and implement appropriate safeguards in accordance with Japan’s Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI) and JIS Q 15001.

**Note:** When Amazon SES is used as the sending provider, all email processing remains strictly within AWS’s Japan region. No data is transferred outside the country.
